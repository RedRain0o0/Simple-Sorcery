TW: Self Harm

Simple Sorcery aims to be a new take on magic in Minecraft.

The mod adds 3 new items and a few new structures to the game. These include:

- Potion of Archaic Healing
- Archaic Knife
- Conjuring Staff
- Wizards Tower
- Hobbits Hut
This mod uses Runes as it's form of sorcery. Runes can be learned from Rune Books, which can be found in a Wizards Tower, the Hobbit Hut, or in a Village Church. On the opening of a Rune Book, the player will take 5 damage, and will be able to use the Rune. To use a Rune, you'll need an Archaic Knife. Put your Archaic Knife in your Off-Hand and right click to open the carving menu. You can have 4 active Runes at any given time. Refer to the Rune Book on the Top Left of your screen, and copy the Rune symbol on your arm.
