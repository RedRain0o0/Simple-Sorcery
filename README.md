### How does it work?

This mod uses Runes as it's form of sorcery. Runes can be learned from Rune Books, which can be found in a Wizards Tower, the Hobbit Hut, or in a Village Church. On the opening of a Rune Book, the player will take 5 damage, and will then be able to use the Rune. To use a Rune, you'll need an Runic Knife. Put your Runic Knife in your Off-Hand and right click to open the carving menu. You can have 4 active Runes at any given time. Refer to the Rune Book on the Top Left of your screen, and copy the Rune symbol on your arm. On completion of Rune carving, you'll take a heart of damage.
